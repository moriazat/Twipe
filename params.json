It takes an image and converts it to another image which is visually similar to the black-and-white version of the original image. \r\n\r\nHere is how to do it:\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Open an image in the application.\r\n## Step 2: Choose the settings you like.\r\n### Choose the font set.\r\n### Choose if you want the characters to write on a transparent canvas.\r\n### Choose the tile size.\r\n*Note:* The tile size affects the output image size. For example, if you give an image of size 200x300 pixels and set the tile size to 20, the output image size would be 4000x6000 pixels. Obviously, this also affect the duration of the whole process. \r\n## Step 3: Click on Convert button.",
