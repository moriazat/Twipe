It takes an image and converts it to another image which is visually similar to the black-and-white version of the original image. \r\n\r\nIt is very straight forward and here is how to do it:\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Click on \"Browse\" and choose the image you want to convert.\r\n\r\n![Open up the image you want](https://github.com/moriazat/Twipe/raw/gh-pages/images/screenshots/step1.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Choose the settings you prefer.\r\n\r\n![Choose settings](https://github.com/moriazat/Twipe/raw/gh-pages/images/screenshots/settings.png)\r\n\r\n### Choose the font set.\r\nFrom the first combo box you can choose the font collection set that you want to be used in the process. If you choose \"Single Font\", you can choose the specific font family from the dropdown box below. \r\n\r\n![Choose font set](https://github.com/moriazat/Twipe/raw/gh-pages/images/screenshots/font-set.png)\r\n\r\n### Check \"Use transparent tiles\", if you want the characters to write on a transparent canvas.\r\n\r\n### Choose the tile size.\r\n\r\n*Note:* The tile size affects the output image size. For example, if you give an image of size 200x300 pixels and set the tile size to 20, the output image size would be 4000x6000 pixels. Obviously, this also affect the duration of the whole process. \r\n\r\n## Step 3: Click on \"Convert\" button.\r\n\r\nNow just wait for the process to finish, and you will get the result next to the original image.\r\n\r\n![Showing the result](https://github.com/moriazat/Twipe/raw/gh-pages/images/screenshots/done.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the following image, the \"converted\" image is created by writing ASCII characters on a canvas.\r\n\r\n![Zoomed-in result](https://github.com/moriazat/Twipe/raw/gh-pages/images/screenshots/result-zoomed-in.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
